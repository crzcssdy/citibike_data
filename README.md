# Citi Bike Data
The goal of this workbook is to show the impact of COVID-19 on the use and growth of Citi Bikes across New York City over the course of 2-year intervals (2020, 2022, and 2024). I've used the month of October from 2020, 2022, and 2024 as representative samples rather than the full calendar year due to size restrictions and processing difficulties.

# Information on the Dataset
The datasets used for this workbook were taken from the publicly accessible Citi Bike website here: https://citibikenyc.com/system-data
