# Citi Bike Data
The goal of this workbook is to show the impact of COVID-19 on the use and growth of Citi Bikes across New York City over the course of 2-year intervals (2020, 2022, and 2024). I've used the month of October from 2020, 2022, and 2024 as representative samples rather than the full calendar year due to size restrictions and processing difficulties.

# Information on the Dataset
The datasets used for this workbook were taken from the publicly accessible Citi Bike website here: https://citibikenyc.com/system-data

# Key Insights

1. The purpose of this workbook is to understand what kind of impact COVID-19 left on the use and growth of Citi Bikes within a major metropolitan city such as New York City. My hypothesis was that COVID-19 would drastically decrease the use of Citi Bikes around New York and stagnate its growth during the peak years of COVID and the years following. Based on the sample data I've taken from the Citi Bike website, however, it appears that there wasn't as drastic of an impact as I originally thought, especially in regards to the huge growth of Citi Bike Stations over the 6 year. As we can see in the below image, there appears to have been a large expansion of Citi Bike stations throughout New York City, expanding further East into the Elmhurst area.

2. Interestingly enough, however, it appears that the frequent visits per Bike Station has also changed over the last 6 years. As we can see from the images below, there appears to be a proliferation of stations across New York City yet the visitation per station has dropped. This may be due to expanded option of stops that are now provided by Citi Bike, thus giving riders the option to choose more optimal locations based on their needs rather than the stations that were only previously available.

3. Additionally, we see a steady decline in the use of classic bikes at the most commonly used Bike Stations while also seeing a steady rise in electric bikes. While classic bikes are still overwhelmingly more popular, there appears to be a gradual rise in the use of electric bikes across the board. This may be due to more readily available electric bikes per station or a general interest in using electric bikes due to their ease of use and less exhaustive movement requirement.

4. Next, we see that the most popular End Station location in 2020 and 2022 was the W 21st Street & 6th Aveue location but by 2024, it became E 14th St & University Place. I believe this is due to the lifting of COVID restrictive laws in 2023 which allowed for in-class lectures at NYU along with a rise in tourism and travel to popular New York destinations, such as Union Square.

5. Here, I've created a dashboard utilizing information of Members vs. Casual bike users, analyzing the ride duration, number of riders, and general location of use across New York City. Here, it is evident that member riders outnumber casual riders to a fairly consistent degree across the 6 year timespan. This is interesting because I also previously believed that casual riders would have a larger share of overall rides with Citi Bike, but perhaps the reliablility and growth in availability of Citi Bikes across New York have made them valuable enough for users to subscribe to a membership over other means of transportation.

6. Overall, it appears that COVID impacted Citi Bike usage in ways of popular start and end destinations, with more general locations such as grocery markets and parks as popular destinations during COVID, and post-COVID behavior leaning towards destinations related to schools, places of public gatherings such as churches, and popular tourist destinations and COVID restrictions begin to ease. Despite these restrictions, however, Citi Bikes appeared to proliferate and expand both within the metropolitan area of New York City but even moreso into smaller, suburban regions of New York.
